# Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme
The implementation is divided into two parts:
<ul>
  <li>Splitting an image into shared secret</li>
  <li>Retrieving the image from the shared secret</li>
</ul>

<br/>
Run the code by typing following command in the terminal: 
<br/>

```
python3 Shamir.py 
```

Scope of improvement:
<ul>
  <li>Parallelize matrix computationt</li>
  <li>Work on dynamic part</li>
</ul>
